## Bonzah's Renter's Insurance
Auto rental insurance is personal insurance purchased as part of a rental transaction by renters of automobiles to protect rental cars and damaged third parties. These plans typically are purchased in daily or 24-hour increments and for a duration that matches the rental car contract. For example, if a rental contract is for five days, renters purchase five days of insurance.


## Fleet Insurance
Auto rental fleet insurance is commercial insurance purchased by auto rental companies to protect their fleet of cars on or near their lot and when operated by employees. These plans are typically purchased annually. Auto fleet coverage may extend to renters, but rental operators want to avoid renter claims on company insurance.

# Bonzah Coverages

## Insurance Descriptions

Bonzah allows some liberties here, but we think the most important information to convery to rental customers is:
- Name of the policy and its acronym : E.g., "Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)"
- The italicized description.  E.g., "Covers damages to the rental vehicle when there is an accident with another vehicle."
- Values. E.g., "$35,000 in rental car coverage" or "Up to state minimum requirements for liability coverage."
- What is not covered. E.g., "Renter may still be liable for any damage done to third parties" or "Does not cover damage to the rental vehicle"
