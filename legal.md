# Bonzah Disclaimer
### The Disclaimer is most important.

You may embed this as part of your own Terms and Conditions. Locations isnâ€™t as important to Bonzah as including it on the rental car site.

By selecting any of these insurances, the renter agrees to these [Terms and Conditions](https://bonzah.com/company/terms), [Privacy](https://bonzah.com/company/privacy), and [Covered Vehicles](https://bonzah.com/restricted-vehicle-types). Insurance is only for drivers 21 years and older with a valid driver's license. Unlicensed drivers are not entitled to coverage under any circumstances. The renter will be responsible for any unlisted additional drivers. Insurance may not apply if the renter or additional driver violates the rental agreement or violates traffic regulations. 

<br><br>

## Configuration Rewuirements and Customuzed API Usage
In addition to the requirements and guidelines above, Bonzah has additional usage requirements that you should be aware of.

<br><br>

## Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI) Requirement 
Bonzah SLI Insurance is sold as secondary or supplemental policy, which means that it must have a primary insurance "attached" to it. Currently, we require our SLI insurance to be purchased along with our RCLI coverage. SLI cannot be purchased as a standalone policy and should be offered only with RCLI to renters. A rental car company or you may exclude to offer it all together. RCLI can be purchased as a standalone policy. This policy is in place because there is a high-level of renter intent to purchase primary liability insurance, and then they inadvertently purchase SLI only as secondary coverage.
<br><br>

## Personal Accident/Effects Insurance (PAI)
Personal Accident/Effects Insurance is not rental car coverage and is occupant injury and loss coverage for the renter and passengers in the rental car. We recommend displaying this coverage separately from our CDW, RCLI, and SLI coverages.  
<br><br>

## Vehicle Restrictions
Bonzah restricts the use of Bonzah insurance with some vehicles, typically high-end and high-performance automobiles. We will work to automate these restrictions via our APIs over time and would like to work with you on how to approach this today. Please see our site for more information.   
<br><br>

## Commercial Use Restrictions
Bonzah also restricts the use of Bonzah insurance for use with commercial vehicles. Purchase for "business travel" is ok, but things like ride share, delivery, and vehicles for hire are restricted. We are developing plans for this type of use with our insurance partners.  Please see our site for more information.
<br><br>

## Time and Date Stamping
Bonzah policy start times are based on the pickup time displayed on the rental contract. For example, if a vehicle is reserved at 12:00, has a scheduled rental start time of 2:00, and the vehicle is actually picked up at 2:30, the insurance start time is 2:30 if 2:30 is printed on the rental contract. If only the scheduled start time is printed on the rental contract, then 2:00 would be the insurance start time. To avoid any potential issues during a claim, we recommend having a date and time printed on the rental car contract. 
<br><br>

## Insurance Payments
When rental car companies are using Bonzah's APIs for embedding insurance as part of a rental reservation process, the rental car company will collect customer payments for both the auto rental and insurance purchase. At the end of the month, we will remit a bill for all insurance purchases made during the month, and rental car companies will pay us the month's outstanding balance for insurance purchases.
<br><br>

## Insurance Price Displayed
When using Bonzah APIs, please display the prices as quoted by Bonzah, unless otherwise expressly agreed to upon in writing.
<br><br>

## Custom Use of APIs
We love creativity and encourage innovative use of our APIs, such as embedding in RMS and rental car company technology. Please remember that a rental company's usage may differ from what we have conceptualized. In these unique use cases, please thoroughly test these uses before putting them into production and ask us for help with any challenges you encounter or concerns you may have.

# Rental Company Onboarding
Bonzah will allow rental car companies to accept insurance payments from renters and accrue rental insurance charges during the month. We will then require the rental car company to remit insurance purchase payments to Bonzah early in the following month. For example, September insurance payments collected by rental car companies will be due in early October. Because we are extending rental car companies' credit and to establish that Pablow Inc. dba bonzah.com is the insurance agent of record, we will require all rental car customers to sign a [User Agreement](https://bonzahuseragreement.tilda.ws/). Here is the link to our rental company onboarding form: [Bonzah Business Partner Onboarding](https://www.jotform.com/form/242344002165141).
